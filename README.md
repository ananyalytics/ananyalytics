# Hello World!

I’m a Data Science and Machine Learning learner currently pursuing **BSc Data Science and Analytics**.
I’m in the early phase of my journey, actively building a portfolio of analytical and ML-driven projects to strengthen my fundamentals. 

## What I’m focusing on:
- Building industry-ready skills in **Python, Data Analysis, ML fundamentals, and SQL**
- Creating meaningful, insight-driven projects
- Developing the mindset of an engineer whose work demonstrates capability before titles do

## My goal:
Grow into a strong, execution-focused ML engineer with a portfolio that clearly reflects skill, consistency, and ambition.
